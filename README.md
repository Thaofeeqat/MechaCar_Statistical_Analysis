* Q1 : The variable/coefficent the provides non random amount of variance to the mpg vale are; 
    * vehicle_weight
    * spoiler_angle
    * AWD
* Q2 : Looking at the p value(which is 5.35) the slope of the linear model is not consider Zero
* Q3 : Yes, linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the R_square was able to show 71% of the data.
