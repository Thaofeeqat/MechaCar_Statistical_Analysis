## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
  Here is the screenshot of the R console showing the linear regression outcome.

* Q1 : The variable/coefficent the provides non random amount of variance to the mpg vale are; 
    * vehicle_weight
    * spoiler_angle
    * AWD
* Q2 : Looking at the p value(which is 5.35) the slope of the linear model is not consider Zero
* Q3 : Yes, linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the R_square was able to show 71% of the data.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
  Hereare the screenshot of both the total_summary and lot_summary table below;
  * Total_Summary

  * Lot_Summary

 * Q1:The current manufacturing data meet the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total_summary because the variance outcome show (62) which is still within the giving range which is 100.
 But looking at the lot individually on two lot falls within the giving range which are; Lot1 and Lot2.
